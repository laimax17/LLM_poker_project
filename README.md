# Cyber Hold'em: 6-Max AI Poker Web App

A cyberpunk-themed Texas Hold'em application featuring a 6-player table (1 Human vs 5 Bots).

> **Note:** The "LLM Persona" integration is currently **disabled**. The bots run on a fast, rule-based algorithmic engine for rapid gameplay testing. LLM integration is planned for a future update.

## 🚀 Features

- **6-Max Table**: Authentic 6-player ring game experience.
- **Fast-Paced AI**: Rule-based bots play quickly (0.5s - 1.0s thinking time) to keep the action moving.
- **Cyberpunk UI**:
    -   **Hexagonal Layout**: Human player always centered at the bottom.
    -   **Turn Indicators**: Pulsing glow and countdown bar for active players.
    -   **Showdown Overlay**: Toggleable results screen to inspect the board and winning hands.
- **Game Engine**: Custom Python 3.9 poker engine handling pot distribution, side pots, and hand evaluation.
- **Dockerized**: One-click deployment for both frontend and backend.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React (Vite), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Zustand.
- **Backend**: Python 3.9 (FastAPI), Socket.IO, Pydantic.
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Docker Compose, Nginx.

## 🏁 Quick Start

### 🐋 New to Docker?
If you don't have Docker installed, follow these steps first:
1.  **Download Docker Desktop**: Go to [docker.com/products/docker-desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and download for your OS (Mac/Windows/Linux).
2.  **Install & Run**: Install the application and open it. Wait for the engine to start (the whale icon in your taskbar should stop animating).
3.  **Verify**: Open a terminal and run `docker --version`. If it prints a version number, you're ready!

### Run with Docker (Recommended)

1. **Start Services**
   Open your terminal in the project folder and run:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
   *This command downloads all dependencies and starts the app. It may take a few minutes the first time.*

2. **Play**
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
   The backend API runs on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

3. **Stop the App**
   Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to stop the server.

### Gameplay Controls
-   **Fold/Check/Call/Raise**: Standard poker actions.
-   **Next Hand**: Manually trigger the next hand after a showdown.
-   **View Board**: Toggle the results modal to see the cards at the end of a hand.

## 🔮 Roadmap / TODO

The following features are planned but not yet enabled:

- [ ] **LLM Integration**: Re-enable the AI Persona system (ChatGPT/Claude) for chat banter and complex bluffing strategies.
- [ ] **Multiplayer Mode**: Allow multiple human players to join via WebSocket.
- [ ] **User Accounts**: persistent chip counts, statistics, and hand history.
- [ ] **Advanced Settings**: Configurable blind structures, starting chips, and difficulty levels.
- [ ] **Sound Effects**: Audio cues for chips, cards, and turns.
